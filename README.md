# Intro 
Hello, this is the to-do list that will be used for the poker hand calculator.
For this project I am trying Test Driven Development in Java using JUnit testing framework.

# Goal
By the end of this project there will be a fully functioning poker hand calculator that will be able 
to determine what type of poker hand a person has depending on the five cards inputted. Along with the final product there will be a full test suite that will come paired with the final product.

# Future Goals
If continued, this project could be implemented in the future to compare two hands and determine which would win.
Going even further this can also be used in a fully functioning Java poker game.
